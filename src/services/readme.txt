The final new folder is the services folder. This folder contains all your code for interfacing with any external API. Generally, on larger projects you will have many different APIs you need to access and this folder is the place to put the code that interacts with those APIs. Again this helps clean up your code since instead of littering a bunch of API interaction code in your application it is all within this one folder.
