The lib folder is another fairly simple folder. This folder contains facades for the various different libraries you use in your project. For example, if you use the axios library then this folder would contain a file for that axios library that creates your own API overtop of the axios API which you then use in your application. This means that instead of importing axios directly in your project you would import the file from this folder associated with axios.
