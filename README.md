# React RK Template

This is a starter project template that includes a number of common and popular technologies used in modern web application development with React.

It is designed to be used in medium and large scale projects that require a scalable architecture and a clear and consistent code organization. The template includes tools like Babel for transpiling code to previous versions of JavaScript, Typescript for adding typing to code, Sass for styling, ReactRouter for route management, LazyLoading for performance optimization, and Redux, along with extensions ReduxThunk, ReduxPromise and ReduxMulti for state management.

Due to the number of technologies included and the scalable architecture, this template is not recommended for small or simple projects that are not intended to grow and become complex. For these types of projects, a simpler template might be more suitable. However, for more complex projects, using this template can provide a solid and efficient foundation for developing modern web apps with React.
